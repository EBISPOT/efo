4. Scope of the Ontology

The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalogue and Centre for Therapeutic Target Validation. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as anatomy, disease and chemical compounds. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by the EBI Functional Genomics Team. We also add terms for external users when requested.

Experimental factors are essentially the variable aspects of an experiment design which can be used to describe an experiment, or set of experiments, in an increasingly detailed manner.  The factors are modelled as classes (i.e. types) within the ontology and properties are used to add information about each type such as a textual definition and synonyms for that term label as well as axiomatic class descriptions such as whether the entity being described is part_of another entity or a subclass of it.

As an application focused ontology, we attempt to import and reuse classes where they exist in external, reference ontologies.

6. Known OWL to OBO Conversion Issues

We are using the OORT library to convert the OWL inferred view of the ontology into OBO. This is a lossy process and works only for the is_a axis. We discard much of the richness that is available in the OWL version of the EFO. We always recommend you use the OWL version of EFO as the primary resource if possible. More information can be obtained from www.ebi.ac.uk/efo or you can download the EFO OWL file directly from www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl
