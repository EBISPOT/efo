**Key Changes in v1.1**:
- **No agent orchestrates others** - copilot-instructions handles routing
- **Agents are specialists** - narrow, well-defined responsibilities
- **Clear boundaries** - no overlapping decision-making

## PR Review (read-only, all platforms)

Reviewing changes is separate from creating them. A **read-only** reviewer checks
a PR or the current branch against the canonical checklist
`docs/agents-documentation/efo-pr-review-checklist.md` and returns a structured
report — it never edits, commits, pushes, or posts.

| Platform | How to invoke |
|----------|---------------|
| Claude Code | run the `efo-pr-review` skill (optionally with a PR number) |
| GitHub Copilot | `@EFO-pr-reviewer review PR #1234` (or the current branch) |
| Codex CLI | "follow `docs/agents-documentation/efo-pr-review-codex.md` to review PR #1234" |

All three point at the same checklist, so they stay in sync. Publishing a review
to the PR (`gh pr comment`) is a separate, explicit step.

## Decision Matrix: What Happens When?

| User Request | Instructions Route | Curator Called? | Importer Called? | Ontologist Called? |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| New term (label only) | Research → validate → integrate | YES (research) | Maybe | YES (integrate) |
| New term (complete info) | Verify → integrate | YES (verify) | Maybe | YES (integrate) |
| Edit definition | Assess → maybe research → edit | If needs citations | NO | YES (edit) |
| Fix typo | Direct to ontologist | NO | NO | YES (edit) |
| Obsolete term | Direct to ontologist | NO | Maybe (if replacement external) | YES (obsolete) |
| Add synonym | Direct to ontologist | Only if validation needed | NO | YES (edit) |

## Common Workflows

### Workflow A: Minimal Info → Full Integration
```
User: "Add term: ATAC-seq"

1. copilot-instructions: Route to curator for research
   ↓
2. Curator: Research literature
   - Search Europe PMC
   - Find definition: "Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin..."
   - Locate PMIDs: 24097267, others
   - Identify parent: "chromatin accessibility assay"
   - Report: "Ready for EFO; parent may need import from OBI"
   ↓
3. copilot-instructions: "Parent not in EFO, call importer"
   ↓
4. 🔗 Importer: Search OLS
   - Find: OBI:0002039
   - Add to obi_terms.txt
   - Confirm: "Import complete"
   ↓
5. copilot-instructions: "Call ontologist to integrate"
   ↓
6. Ontologist: Integration
   - Generate EFO_0990XXX temporary ID
   - Create OWL/XML entry
   - Add SubClassOf OBI:0002039
   - Normalize
   - Commit → PR
   ↓
Done
```

### Workflow B: Complete Info → Quick Verify
```
User: "Add cardiac troponin measurement"
      Definition: [provided]
      PMID: 12345678
      Parent: blood measurement

1. copilot-instructions: Route to curator for verification
   ↓
2. Curator: Validate
   - Check PMID ✅ relevant
   - Verify definition ✅ accurate
   - Confirm parent ✅ appropriate
   - Note: needs "is_about cardiac troponin"
   - Report: "Ready for EFO, import PR:000000058"
   ↓
3. copilot-instructions: "Call importer for cardiac troponin"
   ↓
4. Importer: Import cardiac troponin from PR
   ↓
5. copilot-instructions: "Call ontologist to integrate"
   ↓
6. Ontologist: Integration with logical definition
   ↓
Done
```

### Workflow C: External Ontology Recommendation
```
User: "Add Alzheimer's disease"

1. copilot-instructions: Route to curator
   ↓
2. Curator: Research
   - Search literature ✅
   - Find definition ✅
   - Check MONDO: ✅ MONDO:0004975 exists!
   - Report: "DO NOT create in EFO, import from MONDO"
   ↓
3. copilot-instructions: "Call importer"
   ↓
4. Importer: Import MONDO:0004975
   ↓
Done (imported, not created)
```

### Workflow D: Should Be in OBA
```
User: "Add body mass index measurement"

1. copilot-instructions: Route to curator
   ↓
2. Curator: Research
   - Search literature ✅
   - Find definition ✅
   - Analyze domain: general biological attribute
   - Report: "Create in OBA, not EFO"
   - Provide full validation report
   ↓
3. copilot-instructions → User:
   "This should be created in OBA because it's a general
    biological attribute measurement. Here's the complete 
    validation report to submit to OBA..."
   ↓
Done (no EFO integration, user submits to OBA)
```

## Agent Profiles

### EFO-Ontologist: The Specialist Editor
- **Role**: OWL/XML manipulation expert
- **Mindset**: "How do I format this correctly?"
- **Strengths**: Precise syntax, consistent formatting, git workflow
- **Limitations**: No research, no imports, no orchestration
- **Says**: 
  - "Adding term to efo-edit.owl..."
  - "Generating EFO_0990XXX temporary ID..."
  - "Running normalization..."
  - "Creating PR..."

### EFO-Curator: The Diligent Researcher
- **Role**: Literature research and validation
- **Mindset**: "What does the literature say? Is this accurate?"
- **Strengths**: Deep research, evidence-based, thorough
- **Limitations**: No OWL/XML editing, no imports
- **Says**:
  - "Found 15 papers mentioning this concept"
  - "Definition supported by PMID:12345678"
  - "This actually belongs in OBA based on usage patterns"
  - "Recommend importing from MONDO"

### EFO-Importer: The Efficient Connector
- **Role**: External term import specialist
- **Mindset**: "Where is this term? Is this the right one?"
- **Strengths**: Fast OLS lookups, precise verification
- **Limitations**: Only imports, no integration, no research
- **Says**:
  - "Found in CL as CL:1000348"
  - "Import complete, ready to use"
  - "Term not found in CL, trying UBERON..."

### copilot-instructions: The Orchestrator
- **Role**: Workflow coordination and decision-making
- **Mindset**: "What needs to happen? In what order?"
- **Strengths**: Architectural decisions, agent routing, workflow sequencing
- **Says**:
  - "This needs research first, calling curator..."
  - "Term validated, parent needs import, calling importer..."
  - "Ready to integrate, calling ontologist..."
  - "This belongs in MONDO, not EFO"

## When to Use Which Agent

### Use @EFO-ontologist when:
- You're a user with any request
- Need architectural decision
- Need term integration
- Need obsoletion
- Coordinating multiple agents

### Use @EFO-curator when:
- Need literature research
- Need definition validation
- Unclear what ontology is appropriate
- Missing metadata

### Use @EFO-importer when:
- Need external term imported
- Parent is in another ontology
- Need to check if term exists elsewhere

## Pro Tips

### For Users
1. **Start with ontologist**: Always `@EFO-ontologist` for requests
2. **Provide what you have**: Even partial info is helpful
3. **Trust the process**: Agents will coordinate automatically
4. **Don't worry about ontology choice**: Curator will recommend

### For Ontologist
1. **Always validate**: Even complete requests should go to curator
2. **Think cross-ontology**: Consider MONDO, OBA, CL, UBERON first
3. **Don't skip importer**: Always import parents if they are from a different ontology, never copy-paste
4. **Document decisions**: Explain non-obvious choices in PRs

### For Curator
1. **Be thorough**: More evidence is better than less
2. **Flag uncertainties**: Explicitly state confidence levels
3. **Think domain**: Consider measurement vs disease vs cell type
4. **Recommend boldly**: Don't hesitate to suggest external ontologies

### For Importer
1. **Verify bidirectionally**: Always fetch after search to confirm
2. **Note environment**: GitHub vs VS Code matters
3. **Suggest alternatives**: If term not found, help find it elsewhere

## Success Metrics

### A Good Curator Report Has:
- Clear definition with 2-3 literature sources
- Validated parent term with justification
- PMIDs and DOIs (both when available)
- Synonyms with sources
- Clear ontology recommendation
- Confidence levels stated

### A Good Ontologist Integration Has:
- All required components (label, def, xref, parent)
- Proper OWL/XML formatting
- Logical definitions when appropriate
- Normalized without errors
- Clear commit message
- Complete PR description

### A Good Importer Job Has:
- Correct term found in correct ontology
- Bidirectional verification passed
- IRI added to correct dependency file
- Ready to use in efo-edit.owl

## Red Flags

### Curator Should Flag:
- No literature support found
- Conflicting definitions in papers
- Term seems to belong in another ontology
- Parent term doesn't make sense
- Provided citations don't support definition

### Ontologist Should Flag:
- Curator has low confidence
- Parent term needs importing but not found
- Logical definition doesn't match text definition
- Term already exists in EFO or imports
- Obsoletion would break many relationships

### Importer Should Flag:
- Term not found in expected ontology
- Multiple candidate terms (ambiguous)
- Term doesn't match description
- Ontology mirror is stale

## Common Questions

**Q: Why three agents instead of one?**
A: Separation of concerns. Research skills ≠ Integration skills. Each agent is expert at one thing.

**Q: Can I call curator directly?**
A: Technically yes, but better to go through ontologist who orchestrates the full workflow.

**Q: What if curator says "should be in OBA"?**
A: Ontologist acknowledges and provides report to user for OBA submission. No EFO integration.

**Q: Do I need to know OWL/XML?**
A: No! Just tell ontologist what you want. They handle all the technical details.

**Q: How long does curation take?**
A: Depends on literature availability. Simple terms: fast. Novel concepts: may take research time.

**Q: What if a term exists in multiple ontologies?**
A: Curator researches which is authoritative. Ontologist decides whether to import or create.

**Q: Can I update an agent?**
A: Yes! Edit the `.md` file, update handoff protocol if needed, test with a sample issue.
