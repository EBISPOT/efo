**Key Changes in v1.2**:
- **No agent orchestrates others** - copilot-instructions handles routing
- **Agents are specialists** - narrow, well-defined responsibilities
- **Clear boundaries** - no overlapping decision-making

## 📋 Decision Matrix: What Happens When?

| User Request | Instructions Route | Curator Called? | Importer Called? | Ontologist Called? |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| New term (label only) | Research → validate → integrate | ✅ YES (research) | Maybe | ✅ YES (integrate) |
| New term (complete info) | Verify → integrate | ✅ YES (verify) | Maybe | ✅ YES (integrate) |
| Edit definition | Assess → maybe research → edit | If needs citations | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (edit) |
| Fix typo | Direct to ontologist | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (edit) |
| Obsolete term | Direct to ontologist | ❌ NO | Maybe (if replacement external) | ✅ YES (obsolete) |
| Add synonym | Direct to ontologist | Only if validation needed | ❌ NO | ✅ YES (edit) |

## 🔄 Common Workflows

   ↓
3. 📋 copilot-instructions: "Call importer"
   ↓
4. 🔗 Importer: Import MONDO:0004975
   ↓
Done ✅ (imported, not created)
```

### Workflow D: Should Be in OBA
```
User: "Add body mass index measurement"

1. 📋 copilot-instructions: Route to curator
   ↓
2. 📚 Curator: Research
   - Search literature ✅
   - Find definition ✅
   - Analyze domain: general biological attribute

   - Provide full validation report
   ↓
3. 📋 copilot-instructions → User:
   "This should be created in OBA because it's a general
    biological attribute measurement. Here's the complete 
    validation report to submit to OBA..."
   ↓
Done 🚫 (no EFO integration, user submits to OBA)
```

## 🎨 Agent Profiles

### 🎭 EFO-Ontologist: The Specialist Editor
- **Role**: OWL/XML manipulation expert
- **Mindset**: "How do I format this correctly?"
- **Strengths**: Precise syntax, consistent formatting, git workflow
- **Limitations**: No research, no imports, no orchestration
- **Says**: 
  - "Adding term to efo-edit.owl..."
  - "Generating EFO_0920XXX..."
  - "Running normalization..."
  - "Creating PR..."

### 📚 EFO-Curator: The Diligent Researcher
- **Role**: Literature research and validation
- **Mindset**: "What does the literature say? Is this accurate?"
- **Strengths**: Deep research, evidence-based, thorough
- **Limitations**: No OWL/XML editing, no imports
- **Says**:
  - "Found 15 papers mentioning this concept"
  - "Definition supported by PMID:12345678"
  - "This actually belongs in OBA based on usage patterns"
  - "Recommend importing from MONDO"

### 🔗 EFO-Importer: The Efficient Connector
- **Role**: External term import specialist
- **Mindset**: "Where is this term? Is this the right one?"
- **Strengths**: Fast OLS lookups, precise verification
- **Limitations**: Only imports, no integration, no research
- **Says**:
  - "Found in CL as CL:1000348"
  - "Import complete, ready to use"
  - "Term not found in CL, trying UBERON..."

### 📋 copilot-instructions: The Orchestrator
- **Role**: Workflow coordination and decision-making
- **Mindset**: "What needs to happen? In what order?"
- **Strengths**: Architectural decisions, agent routing, workflow sequencing
- **Says**:
  - "This needs research first, calling curator..."
  - "Term validated, parent needs import, calling importer..."
  - "Ready to integrate, calling ontologist..."
  - "This belongs in MONDO, not EFO"

## 🔧 When to Use Which Agent

### Use @EFO-ontologist when:
- ✅ You're a user with any request
- ✅ Need architectural decision
- ✅ Need term integration
- ✅ Need obsoletion
- ✅ Coordinating multiple agents

### Use @EFO-curator when:
- ⚠️ (Called by ontologist)
- ✅ Need literature research
- ✅ Need definition validation
- ✅ Unclear what ontology is appropriate
- ✅ Missing metadata

### Use @EFO-importer when:
- ⚠️ (Called by ontologist)
- ✅ Need external term imported
- ✅ Parent is in another ontology
- ✅ Need to check if term exists elsewhere

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Users
1. **Start with ontologist**: Always `@EFO-ontologist` for requests
2. **Provide what you have**: Even partial info is helpful
3. **Trust the process**: Agents will coordinate automatically
4. **Don't worry about ontology choice**: Curator will recommend

### For Ontologist
1. **Always validate**: Even complete requests should go to curator
2. **Think cross-ontology**: Consider MONDO, OBA, CL, UBERON first
3. **Don't skip importer**: Always import parents if they are from a different ontology, never copy-paste
4. **Document decisions**: Explain non-obvious choices in PRs

### For Curator
1. **Be thorough**: More evidence is better than less
2. **Flag uncertainties**: Explicitly state confidence levels
3. **Think domain**: Consider measurement vs disease vs cell type
4. **Recommend boldly**: Don't hesitate to suggest external ontologies

### For Importer
1. **Verify bidirectionally**: Always fetch after search to confirm
2. **Note environment**: GitHub vs VS Code matters
3. **Suggest alternatives**: If term not found, help find it elsewhere

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### A Good Curator Report Has:
- ✅ Clear definition with 2-3 literature sources
- ✅ Validated parent term with justification
- ✅ PMIDs and DOIs (both when available)
- ✅ Synonyms with sources
- ✅ Clear ontology recommendation
- ✅ Confidence levels stated

### A Good Ontologist Integration Has:
- ✅ All required components (label, def, xref, parent)
- ✅ Proper OWL/XML formatting
- ✅ Logical definitions when appropriate
- ✅ Normalized without errors
- ✅ Clear commit message
- ✅ Complete PR description

### A Good Importer Job Has:
- ✅ Correct term found in correct ontology
- ✅ Bidirectional verification passed
- ✅ IRI added to correct dependency file
- ✅ Ready to use in efo-edit.owl

## 🚨 Red Flags

### Curator Should Flag:
- 🚩 No literature support found
- 🚩 Conflicting definitions in papers
- 🚩 Term seems to belong in another ontology
- 🚩 Parent term doesn't make sense
- 🚩 Provided citations don't support definition

### Ontologist Should Flag:
- 🚩 Curator has low confidence
- 🚩 Parent term needs importing but not found
- 🚩 Logical definition doesn't match text definition
- 🚩 Term already exists in EFO or imports
- 🚩 Obsoletion would break many relationships

### Importer Should Flag:
- 🚩 Term not found in expected ontology
- 🚩 Multiple candidate terms (ambiguous)
- 🚩 Term doesn't match description
- 🚩 Ontology mirror is stale

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Why three agents instead of one?**
A: Separation of concerns. Research skills ≠ Integration skills. Each agent is expert at one thing.

**Q: Can I call curator directly?**
A: Technically yes, but better to go through ontologist who orchestrates the full workflow.

**Q: What if curator says "should be in OBA"?**
A: Ontologist acknowledges and provides report to user for OBA submission. No EFO integration.

**Q: Do I need to know OWL/XML?**
A: No! Just tell ontologist what you want. They handle all the technical details.

**Q: How long does curation take?**
A: Depends on literature availability. Simple terms: fast. Novel concepts: may take research time.

**Q: What if a term exists in multiple ontologies?**
A: Curator researches which is authoritative. Ontologist decides whether to import or create.

**Q: Can I update an agent?**
A: Yes! Edit the `.md` file, update handoff protocol if needed, test with a sample issue.
