For new term requests, we recommend that you provide a spreadsheet-based information for the optimal turn-around time. For the term to appear in the next monthly release, please allow 2 weeks before the release date (15th of the month, or the Monday after if the 15th falls on Fri-Sun). Examples of the information needed can be found here:

For a single-term request, you may also use the spreadsheet template to give us the information. Alternatively, you may also use the following section to submit the information. Please avoid using the following form to submit request for multiple terms as it may result in delay in processing.
