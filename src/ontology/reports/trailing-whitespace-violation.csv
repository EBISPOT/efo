Summary

Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome is characterized by branchial arch anomalies (branchial clefts, fistulae, cysts), hearing impairment (malformations of the auricle with pre-auricular pits, conductive or sensorineural hearing impairment), and renal malformations (urinary tree malformation, renal hypoplasia or agenesis, renal dysplasia, renal cysts). Prevalence is 1/40,000. Renal involvement can lead to chronic renal insufficiency. The expression of the disease varies widely from one family to another and among individuals of the same family. Some families do not present with renal abnormalities or a urinary tree malformation. BOR syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. The causative gene, EYA1, is located on the long arm of chromosome 8. Point mutations and deletions in EYA1 have been identified in approximately 40% of affected individuals. Mutations have also been identified in the SIX1 and SIX5 genes, the products of which interact with EYA1 to form transcription factor complexes. Prenatal testing can be proposed to families in which the disease-causing mutation has been identified, but genetic counseling is difficult because of the clinical heterogeneity between individuals. Management of affected patients includes excision of branchial fistulae or cysts, hearing aids and education programs appropriate for the hearing impaired, and follow-up by a nephrologist. Dialysis or renal transplantation may be required. "

http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0007736,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/definition,"Diabetes in NOD/ShiLtJ mice is characterized by insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. Marked decreases in pancreatic insulin content occur in females at about 12 weeks of age and several weeks later in males. Onset of diabetes is marked by moderate glycosuria and by a non-fasting plasma glucose higher than 250 mg/dl. Diabetic mice are hypoinsulinemic and hyperglucagonemic, indicating a selective destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells. Susceptibility to IDDM in NOD/ShiLtJ mice is polygenic, and environment, including housing conditions, health status, and diet, exerts a strong effect on penetrance. NOD/ShiLtJ females are more widely used than males because the onset of IDDM symptoms occurs earlier and with a higher incidence (90-100% by 30 weeks of age). NOD/ShiLtJ males develop IDDM at a frequency of between 40-60% by 30-40 weeks of age. Male mice are useful for certain applications, including pharmaceutical studies, ""accelerated transfer"" of IDDM, and some in vitro studies. The major component of diabetes susceptibility in NOD mice is the unique MHC haplotype (H2g7 = Kd, Aad, Abg7, Enull, Db). NOD mice also exhibit multiple aberrant immunophenotypes including defective antigen presenting cell immunoregulatory functions, defects in the regulation of theT lymphocyte repertoire, defective NK cell function, defective cytokine production from macrophages (Fan et al., 2004) and impaired wound healing. They also lack hemolytic complement, C5. NOD/ShiLtJ mice also are severely hearing-impaired. A variety of mutations causing immunodeficiencies, targeted mutations in cytokine genes, as well as transgenes affecting immune functions, have been backcrossed into the NOD/ShiLt inbred strain background.

Diabetes onset was monitored weekly between the ages of 3 and 30 weeks in 120 male and 120 female NOD/ShiLtJ bred in the Bar Harbor and Sacramento facilities. Mice were fed a 6% fat diet (LabDiet 5K0Q, St. Louis MO), ad libitum. Diabetes was defined by a non-fasting blood glucose level exceeding 250 mg/dL. Blood was sampled from the submandibular route and analyzed using a OneTouch Ultra 2 handheld glucometer that was validated using a control solution on each measurement day. Data were combined from three independent studies, each involving 40 males and 40 females. The median female onset was 17 weeks in each study, and the Kaplan-Meier curves from the individual studies did not differ significantly. "

This lining is made up of cells called transitional cells that look like the cells that line the ureters and bladder. Cancers that develop from these cells look like other urothelial carcinomas, such as bladder cancer, under the microscope. Like bladder cancer, these cancers are often linked to cigarette smoking and being exposed to certain cancer-causing chemicals in the workplace.

People with TCC often have the same signs and symptoms as people with renal cell cancer − blood in the urine and, sometimes, back pain.

These cancers are usually treated by surgically removing the whole kidney and the ureter, as well as the portion of the bladder where the ureter attaches. Smaller, less aggressive cancers can sometimes be treated with less surgery. Chemotherapy (chemo) is sometimes given before or after surgery, depending on how much cancer is found.
