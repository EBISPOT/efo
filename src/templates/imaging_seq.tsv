efo:EFO_0008989	ISS	assay	in situ sequencing	In situ sequencing is a method for parallel targeted analysis of short RNA fragments in morphologically preserved cells and tissue. The method is based on padlock probing, rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and sequencing-by-ligation chemistry	PMID:23852452	RNA	Dani Welter
efo:EFO_0008990	FISSEQ	assay	fluorescent in situ sequencing	genome-wide profiling of gene expression in situ in fixed cells and tissues, in which RNA is converted into cross-linked cDNA amplicons and sequenced manually on a confocal microscope	PMID:25675209	RNA	Dani Welter
efo:EFO_0008991	seqFISH	assay	sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization	seqFISH is an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method	PMID:27764670	RNA	Dani Welter
efo:EFO_0008992	MERFISH	assay	multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization	MERFISH is an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics in which RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes	PMID:27625426	RNA	Dani Welter
efo:EFO_0008993	Ex-FISH	assay	expansion fluorescence in situ hybridization	Ex-FISH is a fluorescent in situ hybrization approach which separates RNAs through covalent attachment to a swellable polyelectrolyte gel synthesized throughout a biological specimen. It supports amplification of single-molecule signals as we as multiplexed RNA FISH readout.	PMID:27376770	RNA	Dani Welter
efo:EFO_0008994	spatial transcriptomics	assay		assay that allows visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome with spatial resolution in individual tissue sections	PMID:27365449	RNA	Dani Welter
